# Pre-Installation

### Requirements
Here is a list of all things you need to install the list!

1. A copy of Skyrim SE on steam with the AE DLC.
2. 50gbs of storage. This includes both the downloaded files and the main modlist install
3. The latest wabbajack version from their website. 
4. [Microsoft Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
5. [.Net Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime)
6. Nexus Premium (Whilst not required it will speed up the install)

### Setting up Skyrim

You will need to reinstall skyrim from scratch. This is to ensure the game folder is clean and Wabbajack will have no issues sorting the files.

1. Go into steam, locate Skyrim Special Edition, Right click, Manage and Uninstall.
2. The locate where the game was installed prior to uninstallation and delete any remaining files
3. Go to "C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\My Games" and delete the "Skyrim Special edition" folder.
4. Now go back into steam and install Skyrim Special Edition once again. Make sure to install it somewhere other than a system controlled folder. So do not install it in Program Files.
5. Once installed you will need to run the game once, first to load user settings and then after that launch the main game. Once on the main menu select "Download" on the AE content pop up. If this does not show up straight away you do not have the AE DLC.
6. Once the download has completed you will be able to close the game and move onto the next step.

### Wabbajack Installation

Wabbajack is a simple program to get set up and shouldn't be too much of a hassle even if you have never heard about it before. 

1. Firstly head to the [Wabbajack Download Page](https://www.wabbajack.org) and download the .exe to a location that is not a system controlled folder. I usually choose a folder I call "Bethesda Modding" on a seperate drive.
2. Once you have the .exe in its own folder "G:\bethesdaModding\Wabbajack". You can run the program.
3. Once the application loads you will need to configure some settings. 
4. At the top right there will be a cog icon, click that.
5. From there find the "Logins" Tab and login into nexus mods with your account.
6. Wabbajack should be now configured!

# Installation

Now we can get to the good bit!

Follow these Steps for greatness.

1. Open Wabbajack
2. On the main screen click "Browse Modlists"

3. Tick "Show Unofficial Lists"
4. Search for "Deckborn"
5. Click the Download Icon on the card.
6. Once the download has finished click the Play Icon on the same card.
7. Now you will have some boxes to fill out 
8. The "Target Modlist" Will auto fill so do not worry about that
9. "Modlist Installation Location" Is where the actual list gets installed. So whereever you set this the mod list will end up after the installation.
10. "Resource Download Location" Is where all the downloaded files get stored. So you can put this somewhere else if you need to like and external drive!
11. After this has been fileld out just press the Play button to start the installer!

Now if all goes well the list should install without a problem, however as all things tech related, errors are bound to occur. If this does happen please join the discord to get installation support.
