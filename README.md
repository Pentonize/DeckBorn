# PreInstallation

### Requirements
Here is a list of all things you need to install the list!

1. A copy of Skyrim SE on steam with the AE DLC.
2. 50gbs of storage. This includes both the downloaded files and the main modlist install
3. The latest wabbajack version from their website. 
4. [Microsoft Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
5. [.Net Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime)
6. Nexus Premium (Whilst not required it will speed up the install)

### Setting up Skyrim

You will need to reinstall skyrim from scratch. This is to ensure the game folder is clean and Wabbajack will have no issues sorting the files.

1. Go into steam, locate Skyrim Special Edition, Right click, Manage and Uninstall.
2. The locate where the game was installed prior to uninstallation and delete any remaining files
3. Go to "C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\My Games" and delete the "Skyrim Special edition" folder.
4. Now go back into steam and install Skyrim Special Edition once again. Make sure to install it somewhere other than a system controlled folder. So do not install it in Program Files.
